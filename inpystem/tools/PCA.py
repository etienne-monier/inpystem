"""
This module implements tools to perform PCA transformation.

The main element is the **PcaHandler** class which is a user interface.
It performs direct and inverse PCA transformation for 3D data.

**Dimension_Reduction** is the background function which performs PCA
while the **EigenEstimate** function improves the estimation of PCA
eigenvalues.
